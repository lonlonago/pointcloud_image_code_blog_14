Kimera's Semantic SLAM System for Real-Time Reconstruction 

 Kimera is a C++ implementation of a semantic SLAM system with real-time metrics, using sensors with cameras and IMU inertial navigation data to build a semantically labeled 3D mesh of the environment. Kinera supports an efficient modular open source solution with ROS running on the CPU. Contains four modules: Fast and accurate vision-inertial odometer VIO pipeline (Kimera-VIO) Robust pose-based graph optimization complete SLAM implementation (Kimera-RPGO) Single and multi-frame 3D mesh generator (Kimera-Mesher) Semantic label 3D mesh generator (Kimera-Semantics) github: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera

 The paper provides an open-source C++ library for measuring semantic visual inertial simultaneous localization and composition systems (SLAM) in real time. The library goes beyond existing visual and visual inertial SLAM libraries (e.g. ORB-SLAM, VINSMono, OKVIS, ROVIO) to implement mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in a 3D environment. Kimera's design takes modularity into account, and it has four key components: a visual inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust attitude graph global trajectory estimation optimizer, a lightweight 3D mesh module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run individually or in combination, so Kimera can easily be modified to function individually as a VIO or as a complete SLAM system. Kimera is ROS-based running in real-time on the CPU to generate a three-dimensional metric semantic grid from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained through modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy provided by Kimera will provide a solid foundation for future metrics semantic SLAM and perception research, and allow researchers to upgrade their research across multiple domains (e.g. VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, benchmarking and prototype development of their own work without the need to start from scratch). Scheme Comparison Kimeta is an open-source C++ library for real-time measurement of semantic SLAM. Figure (a) Visual inertial state estimation at IMU rates, and globally consistent robust trajectory estimation, computed (b) a scene low-latency local mesh that can be used for fast obstacle avoidance, and constructed (c) a globally semantically annotated 3D mesh that accurately reflects the ground true value model (d). 

 The main contents and contributions of Kimera are stereo images and inertial navigation measurements, and the outputs are: (1) efficient state estimation by IMU; (2) globally consistent trajectory estimation; (3) multiple environmental grids, including fast local grids and global grids based on semantic labels.

 Kimera uses four threads to receive input and output (e.g. IMUs, image frames, and keyframes) at different frame rates. 

 (1) Kimera-VIO front end, which acquires stereoscopic images and IMU data. The front end performs online pre-integration to obtain a concise pre-integration measurement of the relative state between two consecutive key frames from the raw IMU data. The visual front end detects Shi-Tomasi corners, tracks them across frames using the Lukas-Kanade tracker, finds left and right stereo matches, and performs geometric verification. And outputs IMU measurements of characteristic trajectories and pre-integration. And publishes state estimates based on IMU frame rate. 

 (2) Kimera-VIO outputs optimized state estimation, and at each key frame, pre-integrated IMU and visual measurements are added to the constituent VIO backend.

 (3) Pose map optimization Kimera-RPG, detecting the closed loop between the current key frame and the past key frame. Closed loop detection relies on the DBoW2 library, using bag-of-word notation to quickly detect the assumed closed loop. Closed loop can be detected, out-of-frame points can be eliminated, and globally consistent trajectories can be estimated. Two types of 3D meshes are quickly generated by Kimera-Mesher: single-frame mesh and multi-frame mesh (that is, the surface reconstruction after triangulation of the point cloud, etc.) 

 (4) Kimera-Semantics semantic labels, based on Kimera-VIO's pose estimation, using 2D semantically annotated images (generated at each key frame) to semantically annotate the global grid; 2D semantic labels can be obtained with off-the-shelf tools for pixel-level 2D semantic segmentation to obtain a refined semantic label grid.
